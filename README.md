# Quantum computing Algorithms
## Description
This is a collection of quantum computing algorithms implemented in Python.
They are you can implement in quantum assembly language or in quantum programming languages like Qiskit, Cirq, Q#, QASM.
## Algorithms
Here you can find a list of implemented algorithms:

### Hello world
This is a simple quantum circuit that creates a superposition of 2 qubits and measures them.

### OR in quantum computing

### XOR in quantum computing

### AND in quantum computing

### Quantum teleportation
This is a simple quantum circuit that creates a quantum teleportation of a qubit (our example is 1 and 3).

### Grover algorithm
This is a quantum algorithm that uses Grover's algorithm to search for a target state in a quantum database. The algorithm is implemented in Qiskit and uses the IBM Quantum Experience to run the quantum circuits.

### Condition1 algorithm ((x^y) && (i || j)
In this case we have condition ((y ^ x) && (i || j)) and we wanna get all conditions with result true (you can get also count of results). We can use something like grover algorithm.

### Condition2 algorithm ((x^y) && (i && j)
In this case we have condition ((y ^ x) && (i && j)) and we wanna get all conditions with result true (you can get also count of results). We can use something like grover algorithm.
